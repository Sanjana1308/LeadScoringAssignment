# X Education - Lead Scoring Case Study

## Problem Statement

X Education is an online education company facing challenges in lead conversion. The company receives a high number of leads daily, but the lead conversion rate is relatively low (around 30%). The goal is to identify "Hot Leads" with a higher chance of conversion, increasing the overall lead conversion rate to approximately 80%.

## Data

- The dataset contains approximately 9000 data points.
- Attributes include Lead Source, Total Time Spent on Website, Total Visits, Last Activity, etc.
- Categorical variables may have levels like 'Select' that need to be addressed.

## Goals of the Case Study

### Goal 1: Build a Logistic Regression Model for Lead Scoring

- Develop a logistic regression model to assign lead scores ranging from 0 to 100 to each lead.
- High scores represent leads with a higher likelihood of conversion, while low scores indicate leads less likely to convert.

### Goal 2: Achieve a Higher Lead Conversion Rate

- Target an 80% lead conversion rate using insights from the logistic regression model.

### Goal 3: Data Exploration and Preprocessing

- Analyze the dataset to understand its contents.
- Preprocess data, including handling categorical variables with 'Select' levels.

### Goal 4: Address Additional Problems

- Ensure the logistic regression model is flexible to adapt to future challenges and requirements.
- Prepare to handle other issues presented by the company based on the logistic regression model.


## Conclusion

The success of X Education depends on the ability to target and convert leads effectively. The logistic regression model developed in this case study will be a crucial tool for improving lead conversion rates. The model's flexibility ensures it can adapt to future challenges and requirements, making it a valuable asset for the company.
